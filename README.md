# Day 001 / ∞ — Learning Software Engineering (Core Building)

## Why This Repo Exists

After consuming content across **YouTube, X (Twitter), TikTok**, and blogs, I came to a difficult realization:

> Everyone learns differently.

The internet has made information abundant—but unfiltered. Learning software engineering online often feels chaotic, overcrowded, and directionless. This repository exists to **bring structure, clarity, and accountability** to my learning journey.

Mentorship matters. So does intentional learning.
This repo documents my attempt to strip learning down to **what works for me**.

Recommendations are welcome.

## Learning Methodology

Inspired by **@ColinGalen**, I’m following a **module-based approach**:

* Learn by **modules**, not randomness
* Build strong fundamentals before breadth
* Pedagogy:

  **Theory → Practice → Theory**

### Accountability

* **GitHub** → daily logs & notes (this repo)
* **X (Twitter)** → reflections & progress
* **LinkedIn** → major milestone projects

## The Bigger Picture: Software Engineering

Software Engineering is an ecosystem composed of multiple modules:

* Programming
* Data Structures & Algorithms
* Software Design & Principles
* Architecture
* Operating Systems & Networks
* Cybersecurity
* QA & Testing
* DevOps
* Cloud Computing
* IoT & Embedded Systems
* AI & Machine Learning
* Web & App Development
* Mathematical Computation
* Databases
* SDLC
* UI/UX

## Step 1: Computer Programming

**Language Chosen:** **C++**

Programming is the foundation upon which all other modules depend. C++ was chosen for its ability to expose both **low-level mechanics** and **high-level abstractions**.

## Introduction to C++

* **Creator:** Bjarne Stroustrup (1979)
* **Evolution:** Successor to C
* **Original Name:** *C with Classes*
* **Paradigms:**

  * Procedural
  * Object-Oriented
  * Abstraction
* **Type:** General-purpose language
* **Level:** Low-level (with high-level capabilities)

C++ encourages strong mental models around **memory, performance, and system design**—skills transferable across many domains.

---

## Goal

To build **deep, durable software engineering fundamentals** that scale across:

* Systems programming
* Algorithms & performance-critical software
* Backend & infrastructure
* Advanced computer science concepts

---

## Progress

*  **Day 001 / ∞ — Started**
*  Current Module: **Computer Programming (C++)**

---

## Notes

This repository prioritizes **clarity over speed**, **depth over hype**, and **consistency over motivation**.

Learning is not linear—and that’s okay.

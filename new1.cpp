//testing the difference between my first program and saylor's
//one major difference

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "hello stranger" << endl;
    cin.get();  //the one major difference i know nothing about
    return 0;
}

// observation after running code
// my ouput is printed as usual but theres a new line
//my guess is that since character in is for new inputs it waits for one
//then when i press enter theres no input here so it returns 0
